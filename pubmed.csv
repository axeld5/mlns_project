36459412,Public Trust in Artificial Intelligence Applications in Mental Health Care: Topic Modeling Analysis.,"['AI application', 'Google Play', 'artificial intelligence', 'digital health', 'eHealth', 'health app: mHealth', 'mental disorder', 'mental health', 'mental health care', 'mental illness', 'mobile health', 'public opinion', 'public trust', 'term', 'theme', 'topic', 'topic modeling', 'user feedback', 'user review', 'visualization']",JMIR human factors,"Mental disorders (MDs) impose heavy burdens on health care (HC) systems and affect a growing number of people worldwide. The use of mobile health (mHealth) apps empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being resorted to as a possible solution.
This study adopted a topic modeling (TM) approach to investigate the public trust in AI apps in mental health care (MHC) by identifying the dominant topics and themes in user reviews of the 8 most relevant mental health (MH) apps with the largest numbers of reviewers.
We searched Google Play for the top MH apps with the largest numbers of reviewers, from which we selected the most relevant apps. Subsequently, we extracted data from user reviews posted from January 1, 2020, to April 2, 2022. After cleaning the extracted data using the Python text processing tool spaCy, we ascertained the optimal number of topics, drawing on the coherence scores and used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) TM to generate the most salient topics and related terms. We then classified the ascertained topics into different theme categories by plotting them onto a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling using the pyLDAvis visualization tool. Finally, we analyzed these topics and themes qualitatively to better understand the status of public trust in AI apps in MHC.
From the top 20 MH apps with the largest numbers of reviewers retrieved, we chose the 8 (40%) most relevant apps: (1) Wysa: Anxiety Therapy Chatbot; (2) Youper Therapy; (3) MindDoc: Your Companion; (4) TalkLife for Anxiety, Depression & Stress; (5) 7 Cups: Online Therapy for Mental Health & Anxiety; (6) BetterHelp-Therapy; (7) Sanvello; and (8) InnerHour. These apps provided 14.2% (n=559), 11.0% (n=431), 13.7% (n=538), 8.8% (n=356), 14.1% (n=554), 11.9% (n=468), 9.2% (n=362), and 16.9% (n=663) of the collected 3931 reviews, respectively. The 4 dominant topics were topic 4 (cheering people up; n=1069, 27%), topic 3 (calming people down; n=1029, 26%), topic 2 (helping figure out the inner world; n=963, 25%), and topic 1 (being an alternative or complement to a therapist; n=870, 22%). Based on topic coherence and intertopic distance, topics 3 and 4 were combined into theme 3 (dispelling negative emotions), while topics 2 and 1 remained 2 separate themes: theme 2 (helping figure out the inner world) and theme 1 (being an alternative or complement to a therapist), respectively. These themes and topics, though involving some dissenting voices, reflected an overall high status of trust in AI apps.
This is the first study to investigate the public trust in AI apps in MHC from the perspective of user reviews using the TM technique. The automatic text analysis and complementary manual interpretation of the collected data allowed us to discover the dominant topics hidden in a data set and categorize these topics into different themes to reveal an overall high degree of public trust. The dissenting voices from users, though only a few, can serve as indicators for health providers and app developers to jointly improve these apps, which will ultimately facilitate the treatment of prevalent MDs and alleviate the overburdened HC systems worldwide.",,,"From the top 20 MH apps with the largest numbers of reviewers retrieved, we chose the 8 (40%) most relevant apps: (1) Wysa: Anxiety Therapy Chatbot; (2) Youper Therapy; (3) MindDoc: Your Companion; (4) TalkLife for Anxiety, Depression & Stress; (5) 7 Cups: Online Therapy for Mental Health & Anxiety; (6) BetterHelp-Therapy; (7) Sanvello; and (8) InnerHour.

36356208,Bring Your Own Location Data: Use of Google Smartphone Location History Data for Environmental Health Research.,[],Environmental health perspectives,"Environmental exposures are commonly estimated using spatial methods, with most epidemiological studies relying on home addresses. Passively collected smartphone location data, like Google Location History (GLH) data, may present an opportunity to integrate existing long-term time-activity data.
We aimed to evaluate the potential use of GLH data for capturing long-term retrospective time-activity data for environmental health research.
We included 378 individuals who participated in previous Global Positioning System (GPS) studies within the Washington State Twin Registry. GLH data consists of location information that has been routinely collected since 2010 when location sharing was enabled within android operating systems or Google apps. We created instructions for participants to download their GLH data and provide it through secure data transfer. We summarized the GLH data provided, compared it to available GPS data, and conducted an exposure assessment for nitrogen dioxide (

We believe collecting GLH data is a feasible and cost-effective method for capturing retrospective time-activity patterns for large populations that presents new opportunities for environmental epidemiology. Cohort studies should consider adding GLH data collection to capture historical time-activity patterns of participants, employing a ""bring-your-own-location-data"" citizen science approach. Privacy remains a concern that needs to be carefully managed when using GLH data. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10829.",,,"Of 378 individuals contacted, we received GLH data from 61 individuals (16.1%) and 53 (14.0%) indicated interest but did not have historical GLH data available.

A review of the superior longitudinal and arcuate fasciculus evolving nomenclature.,"['anatomy', 'diffusion tensor imaging', 'diffusion tractography', 'neuroanatomy', 'nomenclature', 'review', 'white matter']","Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)","Studies of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) have multiplied in recent decades owing to methodological advances, but the absence of a convention for nomenclature remains a source of confusion. Here, we have reviewed existing nomenclatures in the context of the research studies that generated them and we have identified their agreements and disagreements. A literature search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE, Web-of-Science, Embase, and a review of seminal publications, without restrictions regarding publication date. Our search revealed that diffusion imaging, autoradiography, and fiber dissection have been the main methods contributing to tract designation. The first two have been particularly influential in systematizing the horizontal elements distant from the lateral sulcus. Twelve approaches to naming were identified, eight of them differing considerably from each other. The terms SLF and arcuate fasciculus (AF) were often used as synonyms until the second half of the 20th century. During the last 15 years, this has ceased to be the case in a growing number of publications. The term AF has been used to refer to the assembly of three different segments, or exclusively to long frontotemporal fibers. Similarly, the term SLF has been employed to denote the whole superior longitudinal associative system, or only the horizontal frontoparietal parts. As only partial correspondence can be identified among the available nomenclatures, and in the absence of an official designation of all anatomical structures that can be encountered in clinical practice, a high level of vigilance regarding the effectiveness of every oral or written act of communication is mandatory.",,,,© 2021 American Association of Clinical Anatomists.,10.1002/ca.23764,2021-07-05,"[{'lastname': 'Porto de Oliveira', 'firstname': 'João Vítor Miranda', 'initials': 'JVM', 'affiliation': 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saúde Pública, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Raquelo-Menegassio', 'firstname': 'Antônio Felipe', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Escola Bahiana de Medicina e Saúde Pública, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Maldonado', 'firstname': 'Igor Lima', 'initials': 'IL', 'affiliation': 'UMR Inserm U1253, iBrain, Université de Tours, Tours, France.\nCHRU de Tours, Tours, France.\nDepartamento de Biomorfologia, Instituto de Ciências da Saúde, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.\nPrograma de Pós-Graduação em Medicina e Saúde, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}]"

PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to February 2020. Included studies were randomized clinical trials in which people with musculoskeletal pain were allocated to an experimental group that received web-based pain education as a standalone approach. Three review authors performed data extraction. The PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and disability.
Six trials with a total of 1664 participants were included. There is moderate-quality evidence with a small effect size that web-based pain education programs, as a standalone approach, are better than minimal intervention (no intervention or booklets) for pain intensity (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.23; 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.04) in the short term and intermediate term (SMD = -0.26; 95% CI = -0.42 to -0.10). Regarding disability, there is low-quality evidence that web-based pain education programs are better than minimal intervention (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.64 to -0.07) in the short term. Web-based pain education added to usual care was no better than usual care alone in the intermediate or long term for primary outcomes.
Web-based pain education for adults with musculoskeletal pain, as a standalone approach, was better than minimal intervention for pain intensity and disability in the short term, and for pain intensity in the intermediate term. Web-based pain education added to usual care did not provide additional benefits for primary outcomes in the intermediate or long term.
Web-based pain education as a standalone intervention provided small improvements in pain intensity and disability in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Poorly resourced settings and overburdened health systems should consider this delivery method in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain.

32421208,Oral galactagogues (natural therapies or drugs) for increasing breast milk production in mothers of non-hospitalised term infants.,[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Many women express concern about their ability to produce enough milk, and insufficient milk is frequently cited as the reason for supplementation and early termination of breastfeeding. When addressing this concern, it is important first to consider the influence of maternal and neonatal health, infant suck, proper latch, and feeding frequency on milk production, and that steps be taken to correct or compensate for any contributing issues. Oral galactagogues are substances that stimulate milk production. They may be pharmacological or non-pharmacological (natural). Natural galactagogues are usually botanical or other food agents. The choice between pharmacological or natural galactagogues is often influenced by familiarity and local customs. Evidence for the possible benefits and harms of galactagogues is important for making an informed decision on their use.
To assess the effect of oral galactagogues for increasing milk production in non-hospitalised breastfeeding mother-term infant pairs.
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), Health Research and Development Network - Phillippines (HERDIN), Natural Products Alert (Napralert), the personal reference collection of author LM, and reference lists of retrieved studies (4 November 2019).
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) comparing oral galactagogues with placebo, no treatment, or another oral galactagogue in mothers breastfeeding healthy term infants. We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials.
We used standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis. Two to four review authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data for analysis and checked accuracy. Where necessary, we contacted the study authors for clarification.
Forty-one RCTs involving 3005 mothers and 3006 infants from at least 17 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted either in hospitals immediately postpartum or in the community. There was considerable variation in mothers, particularly in parity and whether or not they had lactation insufficiency. Infants' ages at commencement of the studies ranged from newborn to 6 months. The overall certainty of evidence was low to very low because of high risk of biases (mainly due to lack of blinding), substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity, and imprecision of measurements. Pharmacological galactagogues Nine studies compared a pharmacological galactagogue (domperidone, metoclopramide, sulpiride, thyrotropin-releasing hormone) with placebo or no treatment. The primary outcome of proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months was not reported. Only one study (metoclopramide) reported on the outcome of infant weight, finding little or no difference (mean difference (MD) 23.0 grams, 95% confidence interval (CI) -47.71 to 93.71; 1 study, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). Three studies (metoclopramide, domperidone, sulpiride) reported on milk volume, finding pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume (MD 63.82 mL, 95% CI 25.91 to 101.72; I² = 34%; 3 studies, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). Subgroup analysis indicates there may be increased milk volume with each drug, but with varying CIs. There was limited reporting of adverse effects, none of which could be meta-analysed. Where reported, they were limited to minor complaints, such as tiredness, nausea, headache and dry mouth (very low-certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported for infants. Natural galactagogues Twenty-seven studies compared natural oral galactagogues (banana flower, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, ixbut, levant cotton, moringa, palm dates, pork knuckle, shatavari, silymarin, torbangun leaves or other natural mixtures) with placebo or no treatment. One study (Mother's Milk Tea) reported breastfeeding rates at six months with a concluding statement of ""no significant difference"" (no data and no measure of significance provided, 60 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (fennel, fenugreek, moringa, mixed botanical tea) reported infant weight but could not be meta-analysed due to substantial clinical and statistical heterogeneity (I
Due to extremely limited, very low certainty evidence, we do not know whether galactagogues have any effect on proportion of mothers who continued breastfeeding at 3, 4 and 6 months. There is low-certainty evidence that pharmacological galactagogues may increase milk volume. There is some evidence from subgroup analyses that natural galactagogues may benefit infant weight and milk volume in mothers with healthy, term infants, but due to substantial heterogeneity of the studies, imprecision of measurements and incomplete reporting, we are very uncertain about the magnitude of the effect. We are also uncertain if one galactagogue performs better than another. With limited data on adverse effects, we are uncertain if there are any concerning adverse effects with any particular galactagogue; those reported were minor complaints. High-quality RCTs on the efficacy and safety of galactagogues are urgently needed. A set of core outcomes to standardise infant weight and milk volume measurement is also needed, as well as a strong basis for the dose and dosage form used.",,,,"Copyright © 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

These concepts include steps as the search and assessment of relevant research findings and consideration of individual aspects. In addition, owners and other persons involved in animal health care should be included in shared decision-making. Some breeders have good basic knowledge concerning breeding management and characteristics of diseases and concerning advantages and disadvantages of different therapeutic approaches, while others are notable to understand complex medical interrelations or emergency situations. All these aspects need to be addressed when communicating and discussing different diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic options. In special fields, such as small animal reproduction, veterinarians often see animals with rare diseases or complex conditions so that an application of standard therapies and well-established textbook recommendations is not possible. To learn more about cases too rare for successful systematic research, the case collection tool REPROCASES (www.evssar.org/reprocases) is now available. The aim of this project is to gather information from specialists on small animal reproduction in a multicentre approach. If you see rare or not well-investigated cases such as cystic ovarian diseases, cryptorchidism or others, you are more than welcome to share your findings via the database. Even if this approach cannot completely replace standardized clinical trials, the idea is to gather more information on effects, prognosis, side effects and long-term fertility for specific conditions.",,,,© 2020 The Authors.

31264211,Psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine in adults.,[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,"Migraine is a common neurological problem associated with the highest burden amongst neurological conditions in terms of years lived with disability. Medications can be used as prophylaxis or rescue medicines, but are costly and not always effective. A range of psychological interventions have been developed to manage migraine.
The objective was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of psychological therapies for the prevention of migraine in adults.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from their inception until July 2018, and trials registries in the UK, USA, Australia and New Zealand for randomised controlled trials of any psychological intervention for adults with migraine.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of a psychological therapy for people with chronic or episodic migraine, with or without aura. Interventions could be compared to another active treatment (psychological or medical), an attention-placebo (e.g. supportive counselling) or other placebo, routine care, or waiting-list control. We excluded studies where fewer than 15 participants completed each arm.
We extracted study characteristics and outcome data at post-treatment and the longest available follow-up. We analysed intervention versus control comparisons for the primary outcome of migraine frequency. We measured migraine frequency using days with migraines or number of migraine attacks measured in the four weeks after treatment. In addition, we analysed the following secondary outcomes: responder rate (the proportion of participants with a 50% reduction in migraine frequency between the four weeks prior to and the four weeks after treatment); migraine intensity; migraine duration; migraine medication usage; mood; quality of life; migraine-related disability; and proportion of participants reporting adverse events during the treatment. We included these variables, where available, at follow-up, the timing of which varied between the studies. We used the GRADE approach to judge the quality of the evidence.
We found 21 RCTs including 2482 participants with migraine, and we extracted meta-analytic data from 14 of these studies. The majority of studies recruited participants through advertisements, included participants with migraine according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and those with and without aura. Most intervention arms were a form of behavioural or cognitive-behavioural therapy. The majority of comparator arms were no treatment, routine care or waiting list. Interventions varied from one 20-minute session to 14 hours of intervention. No study had unequivocally low risk of bias; all had at least one domain at high risk of bias, and 20 had two to five domains at high risk. Reporting of randomisation procedures and allocation concealment were at high or unclear risk of bias. We downgraded the quality of evidence for outcomes to very low, due to very serious limitations in study quality and imprecision. Reporting in trials was poor; we found no preregistrations stipulating the outcomes, or demonstrating equivalent expectations between groups. Few studies reported our outcomes of interest, most only reported outcomes post treatment; follow-up data were sparse.Post-treatment effectsWe found no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions for migraine frequency in number of migraines or days with migraine (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.13; 4 studies, 681 participants; very low-quality evidence).The responder rate (proportion of participants with migraine frequency reduction of more than 50%) was greater for those who received a psychological intervention compared to control: 101/186 participants (54%) with psychological therapy; 37/152 participants (24%) with control (risk ratio (RR) 2.21, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.98; 4 studies, 338 participants; very low-quality evidence). We found no effect of psychological therapies on migraine intensity (SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.02; 4 studies, 685 participants). There were no data for migraine duration (hours of migraine per day). There was no effect on migraine medication usage (SMD -0.06, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.24; 2 studies, 483 participants), mood (mean difference (MD) 0.08, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.49; 4 studies, 432 participants), quality of life (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.26; 4 studies, 565 participants), or migraine-related disability (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.00; 6 studies, 952 participants). The proportion of participants reporting adverse events did not differ between those receiving psychological treatment (9/107; 8%) and control (30/101; 30%) (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.00 to 7.85; 2 studies, 208 participants). Only two studies reported adverse events and so we were unable to draw any conclusions.We rated evidence from all studies as very low quality.Follow-upOnly four studies reported any follow-up data. Follow-ups ranged from four months following intervention to 11 months following intervention. There was no evidence of an effect on any outcomes at follow-up (very low-quality evidence).
This review identified 21 studies of psychological interventions for the management of migraine. We did not find evidence that psychological interventions affected migraine frequency, a result based on four studies of primarily brief treatments. Those who received psychological interventions were twice as likely to be classified as responders in the short term, but this was based on very low-quality evidence and there was no evidence of an effect of psychological intervention compared to control at follow-up. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on medication usage, mood, migraine-related disability or quality of life. There was no evidence of an effect of psychological interventions on migraine frequency in the short-term or long-term. In terms of adverse events, we were unable to draw conclusions as there was insufficient evidence. High and unclear risk of bias in study design and reporting, small numbers of participants, performance and detection bias meant that we rated all evidence as very low quality. Therefore, we conclude that there is an absence of high-quality evidence to determine whether psychological interventions are effective in managing migraine in adults and we are uncertain whether there is any difference between psychological therapies and controls.",,,,,"10.1002/14651858.CD012295.pub2

31094356,"Your Robot Therapist Will See You Now: Ethical Implications of Embodied Artificial Intelligence in Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy.","['artificial intelligence', 'ethics', 'medicine', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'psychotherapy', 'robotics']",Journal of medical Internet research,"Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from 'virtual psychotherapists' to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed.
This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI.
Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions.
From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; 'gaps' in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition.
We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.",,,"From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians.

29853560,How tobacco companies have used package quantity for consumer targeting.,"['advertising and promotion', 'packaging and labelling', 'socioeconomic status', 'tobacco industry documents']",Tobacco control,"Package quantity refers to the number of cigarettes or amount of other tobacco product in a package. Many countries restrict minimum cigarette package quantities to avoid low-cost packs that may lower barriers to youth smoking.
We reviewed Truth Tobacco Industry Documents to understand tobacco companies' rationales for introducing new package quantities, including companies' expectations and research regarding how package quantity may influence consumer behaviour. A snowball sampling method (phase 1), a static search string (phase 2) and a follow-up snowball search (phase 3) identified 216 documents, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s, concerning cigarettes (200), roll-your-own tobacco (9), smokeless tobacco (6) and 'smokeless cigarettes' (1).
Companies introduced small and large packages to motivate brand-switching and continued use among current users when faced with low market share or threats such as tax-induced price increases or competitors' use of price promotions. Companies developed and evaluated package quantities for specific brands and consumer segments. Large packages offered value-for-money and matched long-term, heavy users' consumption rates. Small packages were cheaper, matched consumption rates of newer and lighter users, and increased products' novelty, ease of carrying and perceived freshness. Some users also preferred small packages as a way to try to limit consumption or quit.
Industry documents speculated about many potential effects of package quantity on appeal and use, depending on brand and consumer segment. The search was non-exhaustive, and we could not assess the quality of much of the research or other information on which the documents relied.","Industry documents speculated about many potential effects of package quantity on appeal and use, depending on brand and consumer segment.

Exergames, or active videogames, may motivate some adults to engage in physical activity. This review explored the use of exergaming to promote physical activity behaviors and health in adults.
A systematic literature review of the use of exergaming was conducted. The review included experimental studies with a nonclinical adult population, which measured changes in physical activity behaviors and changes in anthropometric healthy weight indicators.
From an initial search that yielded 1644 results, nine articles were found to satisfy the predetermined inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Exergaming provided a novel method for increasing or substituting physical activity in the short term. Although low participation was not associated with anthropometric changes, significant healthy anthropometric changes were associated with moderate to high exergaming participation.
Exergaming may be employed as an effective exercise behavior change strategy in the short term and may have positive health benefits if recommendations are made regarding intensity and duration of play for optimal health outcomes.

The Mother and Child Health Handbook (MCHH), a tool used by almost all parents in Japan, serves as a record book shared by parents and health providers to monitor maternal health care throughout the perinatal period, track the child's health and growth, and provide educational information. Methods. A review of the existing literature was performed by narrative review using electronic databases with the search term ""Maternal and Child Health Handbook"" from January 1980 to February 2016. Results. Twenty-eight papers were obtained: 3 review articles, 17 original articles, 2 brief reports, 2 letters, 1 research note, and 3 proceedings. After the MCHH was initiated in 1947, Japan's infant mortality rate decreased to 2.6 per 1000 live births in 2007, and it is still decreasing. Information recorded in the MCHH at antenatal examinations can be used to evaluate a child's risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, endocrine disease, mental illness, and infectious disease. Utah's Department of Health implemented a program called ""Baby Your Baby"" in 1987 based on the Japanese MCHH; this included a similar booklet with family records and educational information. Thus, the MCHH is a unique tool in Japan that has influenced other countries to adopt similar programs. Conclusion. We will confirm the importance of the MCHH's role in promoting health and open dialogue.",,,,,"10.1177/2333794X16649884

Understanding principles of evidence-based medicine allows using the most powerful information source, which have ever existed in medicine.
To evaluate the effectiveness of teaching Evidence-Based Medicine, including long-term outcomes of training.
The study was conducted at the Medical University of Astana, where the Scientific and Educational Center of Evidence-Based Medicine was established in 2010 with the help of the corresponding project of the World Bank. The participants of the study were the faculty trained in Evidence-Based Medicine at the workshop ""Introduction to Evidence-Based Medicine"" for the period of 2010-2015 years. There were a total of 16 workshops during the period, and 323 employees were trained. All participants were asked to complete our questionnaire two times: before the training - pre-training (to determine the initial level of a listener) and after the training - post-training (to determine the acquired level and get the feedback). Questionnaires were prepared in such a way, that the majority of questions before and after training were identical. Thus, it provided a clear picture of the effectiveness of training. Questions in the survey were open-ended so that the respondents had the opportunity to freely and fully express their views. The main part of the questionnaires included the following questions: ""Do you understand what evidence-based medicine is"", ""how do you understand what the study design means"", ""what is randomization"", ""how research is classified"", ""do you know the steps of decision-making according to Evidence-Based Medicine, list them"", ""what literature do you prefer to use when searching for information (print, electronic, etc.)"", ""what resources on the Internet do you prefer to use"".
Only 30-35% of respondents gave correct answers to the questions on understanding EBM, understanding study designs, randomization. There were no correct or complete answers to the question on study classification. Again, 35% of respondents provided correct answer to the question about the stages of decision-making process from the perspective of EBM, 65% - provided no answer. One fourth (25%) of the respondents preferred using printed literature. Only very few respondents indicated Cochrane Library, Medline (PubMed), Tripdatabasa as preferred Internet sources of information, with 40% indicating Google and 60% - other sources.The results of post-training survey showed that nearly 90% of the respondents gave correct answers to all the questions.With the aim to identify knowledge survival (the long-term training outcomes) we conducted the third survey in May 2014 in previously trained people at the seminar ""Introduction to Evidence-Based Medicine"". The respondents were asked to answer 4 questions, and to assess previously obtained information on the basics of Evidence-Based Medicine on a 10-point scale.We found that 100% of the respondents answered «Yes» to the question: «Have you changed your behavior after the seminar?» To the question: «Have you encountered difficulties in implementing the principles of evidence-based medicine in the educational process?» 56% of the respondents answered that they had not encountered any difficulties. The other 44% faced the difficulties associated with implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine: lack of understanding by students, low knowledge survival rate among students, too many questions from the students, difficult disputes and discussions.To the question: «Have you encountered difficulties in implementing the principles of Evidence-Based Medicine in practical health-care?» only 37.5% of the respondents answered that they had not encountered difficulties. But the remaining 62.5% of the respondents faced the problems and difficulties in implementing the principles of evidence-based medicine in their practice. These were: failure in implementing, lack of understanding on the part of colleagues, commitment to traditional obsolete methods of treatment, discrepancy between some of the existing standards of diagnosis and treatment and principles of evidence-based medicine.To the question: «Are there any end products after listening to the seminar?» 67% of the respondents answered in affirmative. The end products were mainly marked by the publication of articles and abstracts, including international publications, and participation in the working group on the revision and development of clinical protocols.
Barriers to implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine in education and practice are lack of funding to provide access to reliable sources of information, websites; outdated research methodology skills in medical education, lack of skills in critical evaluation of medical information; tradition of authoritarian relationships, use of past experience stencils; failure to comply with continuing education programs (""from training to professional development""). Knowledge of Evidence-Based Medicine, skills to perform searches for scientific data, to evaluate their validity and to transform scientific data into practical solutions are necessary for health workers in their daily activities.

This risky profile may be explained by the adverse effects of antipsychotic medications and an unhealthy lifestyle (e.g. smoking, poor nutrition and low physical activity). In the general population, physical activity has been shown to be the optimal strategy to improve both cardiometabolic parameters and cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Accordingly, an emerging literature of non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, diet and physical activity) has been studied in individuals with schizophrenia. Therefore, the purpose of this review was 1) to conduct a critical literature review of non-pharmacological interventions that included some kind of physical activity (including supervised and unsupervised exercise training) and target cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with schizophrenia. 2) To describe the contribution of physical activity alone by reviewing trials of supervised exercise training programmes only. A literature review via systematic keyword search for publications in Medline, PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO was performed. Many non-pharmacological interventions are efficient in reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors when combined with physical activity. Supervised physical activity has been successful in decreasing cardiovascular disease risk, and aerobic interval training appears to provide more benefits by specifically targeting cardiorespiratory fitness levels. In conclusion, physical activity is an effective strategy for addressing cardiovascular disease risk in individuals with schizophrenia. Long-term studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility and impact of exercise training programmes in individuals with schizophrenia.",,,,,10.1080/02640414.2015.1119875,2015-12-03,"[{'lastname': 'Chalfoun', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine , Université de Montréal , Montreal , Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Karelis', 'firstname': 'Antony D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'b Department of Exercise Science , Université du Québec à Montréal , Montreal , Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Stip', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'a Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine , Université de Montréal , Montreal , Canada.\nc CHUM Research Centre (CRCHUM) , Montreal , Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdel-Baki', 'firstname': 'Amal', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""a Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine , Université de Montréal , Montreal , Canada.\nc CHUM Research Centre (CRCHUM) , Montreal , Canada.\nd Clinique Jeunes Adultes Psychotiques (JAP) , Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM) - Notre-Dame Hospital , Montreal , Canada.""}]"

This study presents clinical and laboratory data on 13 newly described cases from Australia (11) and the UK (two).
The disease was most often observed in middle-aged cats (median 7 years of age; interquartile range 5-9 years). Ragdolls (7/13) and males (9/13) were overrepresented. Cats generally had a long history of vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Lesions were typically large, hard, non-painful, easily palpable and most commonly situated near the pylorus or ileocaecocolic junction. Lesions were heterogeneous ultrasonographically and on sectioning at celiotomy or necropsy. Masses were hard and 'gritty' on fine-needle aspiration due to internal trabeculae made up of mature collagen bundles. Bacteria were commonly detected within masses (9/13 cases) using either culture or conventional light microscopy and a panel of special stains, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), although detection often required a diligent search of multiple tissue sections. A consistent bacterial morphology could not be appreciated among the different cases.
Patients were treated with a variable combination of cytoreduction (debulking and biopsy, to complete surgical resection), immunosuppressive therapy and antimicrobial agents. Many cats had a poor outcome, which was attributable to late diagnosis combined with suboptimal management. It is hoped that suggestions outlined in the discussion may improve clinical outcomes and long-term survival in future cases.",,,,© ISFM and AAFP 2015.,10.1177/1098612X14568170,2015-04-22,"[{'lastname': 'Linton', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Eastside Veterinary Emergency and Specialists, 10 Newcastle Street, Rose Bay, NSW, 2029, Australia michael.linton@eastsidevets.com.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Nimmo', 'firstname': 'Judith S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'ASAP Pathology Laboratory, 53 Glenvale Crescent, Mulgrave, VIC, 3170, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Norris', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Churcher', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'North Shore Veterinary Specialist Centre, Crows Nest, NSW, 2065, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Haynes', 'firstname': 'Sophia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Animal Referral and Emergency, Collingwood, VIC 3066, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zoltowska', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Your Vets, 1300 Herald Avenue, Coventry, CV5 6UB, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hughes', 'firstname': 'Sunishka', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Leslie Street Veterinary Clinic, Umina, NSW, 2259, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lessels', 'firstname': 'Naomi S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'Leslie Street Veterinary Clinic, Umina, NSW, 2259, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wright', 'firstname': 'Miranda', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cambridge Cat Clinic, Fulbourn, CB21 5HE, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Veterinary Education, The University of Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia.'}]"

20467595,Effectiveness of sinus lift procedures for dental implant rehabilitation: a Cochrane systematic review.,[],European journal of oral implantology,"Marco Esposito, Pietro Felice and Paul Coulthard are among the authors of four of the included trials, however, they were not involved in the quality assessment of these trials. This review is based on a Cochrane systematic review entitled 'Interventions for replacing missing teeth: augmentation procedures of the maxillary sinus' published in The Cochrane Library (see http:// www.cochrane.org/ for information). Cochrane systematic reviews are regularly updated to include new research and in response to comments and criticisms from readers. If you wish to comment on this review, please send your comments to the Cochrane website or to Marco Esposito. The Cochrane Library should be consulted for the most recent version of the review. The results of a Cochrane Review can be interpreted differently, depending on people's perspectives and circumstances. Please consider the conclusions presented carefully. They are the opinions of the review authors, and are not necessarily shared by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Insufficient bone volume is a common problem encountered in the rehabilitation of the edentulous posterior maxillae with implant supported prostheses. Bone volume is limited by the presence of the maxillary sinus together with loss of alveolar bone height. Sinus lift procedures increase bone volume by augmenting the sinus cavity with autogenous bone and/or commercially available biomaterials.
To test whether and when augmentation of the maxillary sinus is necessary and which are the most effective augmentation techniques for rehabilitating patients with implant-supported prostheses.
The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Several dental journals were hand searched. The bibliographies of review articles were checked, and personal references were searched. More than 55 implant manufacturing companies were also contacted. The last electronic search was conducted on 7th January 2010.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of different techniques and materials for augmenting the maxillary sinus for rehabilitation with dental implants reporting the outcome of implant therapy at least to abutment connection.
Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. Authors were contacted for any missing information. Results were expressed as random-effects models using mean differences for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. The statistical unit of the analysis was the patient.
Ten RCTs out of 29 potentially eligible trials were suitable for inclusion. One trial including 15 patients, evaluated whether 5-mm-long implants with a diameter of 6 mm could be an alternative to sinus lift in bone having a residual height of 4 to 6 mm. Nine trials with 235 patients compared different sinus lift techniques and, of these, four trials (114 patients) evaluated the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Since different techniques were evaluated in different trials, only two meta-analyses evaluating the efficacy of PRP could be performed for implant failures (two trials) and complications (three trials). No statistically significant difference was observed for any of the evaluated interventions.
Conclusions are based on few trials, usually underpowered, having short follow-ups, and often judged to be at high risk of bias, therefore they should be viewed as preliminary and interpreted with great caution. It is still unclear when sinus lift procedures are needed. Short implants (5 mm) can be successfully loaded in maxillary bone with a residual height of 4 to 6 mm, but their long-term prognosis is unknown. Elevating the sinus lining in the presence of 1 to 5 mm of residual bone height without the addition of a bone graft may be sufficient to regenerate new bone to allow rehabilitation with implant-supported prostheses. Bone substitutes might be successfully used as replacements for autogenous bone. If the residual alveolar bone height is 3 to 6 mm, a crestal approach to lifting the sinus lining and placing 8 mm implants may lead to less complications than a lateral window approach and placing implants at least 10 mm long. PRP treatment does not seem to improve the clinical outcome of sinus lift procedures with autogenous bone or bone substitutes.",,,"Ten RCTs out of 29 potentially eligible trials were suitable for inclusion.

The program was made in 17 weekly interactive meetings, where the topics were: adolescent psychology and sexuality; parent-children relationship; family communication; self esteem; and addiction prevention. All of these topics were discussed. To evaluate family relationship the key word used was: How is your family relationship?
There were found at baseline, a smaller family, and lesser family income in the IG. On the other hand, the CG showed higher scores on satisfaction with the academic and work performance; participation and problem solving; power, money and sex; and life satisfaction. At the end of the program, only 4% subjects of the IG and 59% of the CG were available for assessment. At this point we found that all differences have disappeared except life satisfaction, In addition new differences appeared as: in the control group there was a higher score for children's problems, and satisfaction with life.

Searching the literature for published studies on a topic relevant to one's question requires knowledge of databases such as MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, or Hospital Literature Index. PubMed provides access to MEDLINE and over 12 million citations in the medical literature. When searching in PubMed you can apply various ""limits,"" such as what fields the search term is in (eg, author, title, text word, journal), type of report (eg, clinical trial, review, editorial), language, patient age, gender, and human or animal study. The ""Boolean operators"" (AND, OR, and NOT) can further focus and refine your search. However, to be sure that you retrieve all the files of interest and don't miss any files that might be critical to your understanding of the topic, you must search all fields and be careful not to exclude potentially important files with the NOT operator.",,,,,,2004-09-28,"[{'lastname': 'Rau', 'firstname': 'Joseph L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Cardiopulmonary Care Sciences, Georgia State University, PO Box 4019, Atlanta, GA 30302-4019, USA. joerau@comcast.net'}]"
15029788,Reclaim your job.,[],Harvard business review,"Ask most managers what gets in the way of their success, and you'll hear the familiar litany of complaints: Not enough time. Limited resources. No clear sense of how their work fits into the grand corporate scheme. These are, for the most part, excuses. What really gets in the way of managers' success is fear of making their own decisions and acting accordingly. Managers must overcome the psychological desire to be indispensable. In this article, the authors demonstrate how managers can become more productive by learning to manage demands, generate resources, and recognize and exploit alternatives. To win the support they want, managers must develop a long-term strategy and pursue their goals slowly, steadily, and strategically. To expand the range of opportunities, for their companies and themselves, managers must scan the environment for possible obstacles and search for ways around them. Fully 90% of the executives the authors have studied over the past few years wasted their time and frittered away their productivity, despite having well-defined projects, goals, and the necessary knowledge to get their jobs done. Such managers remain trapped in inefficiency because they assume they do not have enough personal discretion or control. They forget how to take initiative--the most essential quality of any truly successful manager. Effective managers, by contrast, are purposeful corporate entrepreneurs who take charge of their jobs by developing trust in their own judgment and adopting long-term, big-picture views to fulfill personal goals that match those of the organization.",,,,,,2004-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Ghoshal', 'firstname': 'Sumantra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'London Business School, U.K. sghoshal@london.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Bruch', 'firstname': 'Heike', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}]"
15023206,How does your searching grow? A survey of search preferences and the use of optimal search strategies in the identification of qualitative research.,[],Health information and libraries journal,"The objective was to gain an overview of researchers experiences of searching the literature, with particular reference to the use of optimal search strategies (OSSs) and searching for qualitative research studies. A 13-item semi-structured questionnaire investigating search behaviour was distributed to members of the Cochrane Qualitative Methods Network. Follow-up interviews were conducted with a subset of respondents to explore issues raised and clarify points of ambiguity. Findings were analysed using data reduction, data displays and verification techniques. Eighty-six per cent of distributed questionnaires were returned. All respondents reported searching electronic databases as part of their literature search, with 80% expressing a preference for searching alone or with colleagues. Forty-one per cent indicated that they consider a database search to be only one aspect of a comprehensive literature search. The rigour and availability of OSSs was a concern for 30% of respondents. Twenty-five per cent of respondents had searched for qualitative studies, although the difficulty of locating this type of literature was considered problematic because of the varied use of the term 'qualitative'. Whilst the majority of respondents reported using OSSs in some capacity, reservations were expressed about their ability to facilitate a comprehensive search. Replies indicated a belief that OSSs can reduce the sensitivity of a search, and might limit the breadth of coverage required. A greater appreciation of the availability and purpose of OSSs-including the ability to optimize either sensitivity or recall-is needed if this enhanced approach to accurate data retrieval and potential improvement in time management is to become widespread.",,,,,10.1111/j.1471-1842.2004.00483.x,2004-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Grant', 'firstname': 'Maria J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Information Scientist, Salford Centre for Nursing, Midwifery and Collaborative Research, University of Salford, Manchester, UK. m.j.grant@salford.ac.uk'}]"

11478187,Evaluation and reporting requirements of the disability examiner.,[],Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America,"Critics of the system within which IMEs occur might argue that there is in fact no such entity as a truly impartial evaluation because the practitioner always is aware of the source of payment for the visit and will color opinions in favor of that payor. Nonetheless, the ethical practitioner has no problem whatsoever refuting that rather cynical attitude. First, payment for any type of clinical visit must come from somewhere. Most importantly, always keep in mind what is in the best medical interest of the person you are examining, and you will avoid virtually all ethical dilemmas. To illustrate obvious examples, if a claimant has the objective impairments of herniated disc with associated radiculopathy, it makes no medical sense, and would certainly be unethical, to allow unrestricted RTW to a physical job. That clearly would not be in the best interest of a patient you were treating, nor should that be your opinion for an IME. Similarly, a person without any objective impairment documented after careful search is not well served by a continuing program of medications, time off work, useless modalities, and a growing ""sickness"" frame of mind. That would definitely not be in their best interest, and your opinion for a treatment case or for an IME should reflect that without hesitation. Once you make a consistent habit of always invoking what you truly believe to be in the best medical interest of the examinee, the long-term interests of the other involved parties will also be well served as a consequence. The insurance company will not be asked to either continue paying treatment and wage replacement costs for someone who could safely work, nor will it be forced to accumulate the unnecessary expenses of recurrent injuries to an injured worker returned to work prematurely. By faithfully adhering to the simple principle of not swaying from the best interest of the examinee, you might lose referral business from some sources. Certain employers, case managers, insurance carriers, attorneys, or others might want to rely on your opinion in all cases, perhaps to conclude that claimants are rarely if ever impaired (or at least not from work or auto accident-related events). Your practice and your reputation are much better off without that business. A well-planned and carefully performed IME, resulting in a detailed, understandable, and defensible report with the elements outlined in this article, will serve you and your referring sources well.",,,,,,2001-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Geiringer', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}]"
9476773,Endoscopy information online: can endoscopists close the gap between what is known and what they do?,[],Endoscopy,"When do you go to the Internet and when do you go to online hosts for information about gastrointestinal endoscopy? This paper describes key concepts such as hosts, online databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE, search engines, retrieval and query languages, and thesauri. The focus is on two specific thesaurus issues: the use (or absence of) complex hierarchical thesauri such as MEDLINE's Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and EMBASE's EMTREE. This allows us to review briefly the great advantages of ""term explosion"" and automatic mapping of synonyms (and the absence of these facilities on the Internet). The introductory section ends with questions on what your information needs are - clinical information? Product information? Patient information? Research information? The main part of the article is concerned with what is available on the Internet and the host services that are available today and in the future. A light glance (perhaps more of a provocative preview) is cast at future developments relevant to information retrieval in the field of endoscopy. Conclusions include the following: - The Internet should be searched for: guidelines, training, and product information. - There is little published research available for free on the Internet. - For published research, search MEDLINE and EMBASE together, or DIMDI, STN or DataStar (in that order of preference). - Search EMBASE if you need the most recent endoscopy research. - Search EMBASE if you need the most recent drug information relevant in endoscopy - Search MEDLINE if you have no budget. - Search PubMed as the preferred (free) form of access to MEDLINE. - Distrust all Internet information.",,,,,10.1055/s-2007-1004324,1998-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Krabshuis', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Highland Data, Argyll, Scotland. 73064.1412@compuserve.com'}]"

8660087,Smoking and other health related behaviour in the social and environmental context.,[],Archives of disease in childhood,"It seems clear that parental smoking is harmful, although the magnitude of its effect may be smaller than sometimes suggested. However, smoking and other behaviours detrimental to health must be seen within a social and historical context. Individuals are not 'free choosing actors' and their behaviour is determined, at least in part, by their social and environmental circumstances. Smoking might better be regarded as a 'proximal' cause. 'Proximal' causes such as infectious or toxic agents are themselves subject to 'causes of causes' which are the determinants of exposure to these agents. Smoking may act as the 'proximal' cause, directly harming the fetus, but is itself caused by factors in the social and environmental circumstances. The complexity of the relationship between social and environmental circumstances, health related behaviours, and adverse outcomes cannot be resolved by the search for single causative agents. As Rutter points out, in order to begin to understand causal complexity 'it is necessary to examine distal causal relationships in the form of chains and of linked sequences involving several different, relatively short-term effects or operations' (p 2). Health promotion programmes sensitive to social context avoid 'victim blaming' and acknowledge that it is not enough to exhort mothers to 'stop smoking before and during pregnancy because this will harm your baby' (p 99). Mothers know that smoking can harm themselves and their babies and the vast majority want to give up. Their choice is limited by their social circumstances, and failure to recognise this has ensured the failure of health promotion initiatives aimed at smoking reduction during pregnancy. There are limitations in the techniques available to control for confounding in multivariate analysis and results must be interpreted with caution. Misinterpretation can lead to overemphasis of the role of single factors, diverting attention from complex pathways. While health related behaviours may be a 'proximal' cause of ill health, there is a duty on researchers, health promoters, and health policy makers to take account of the complex causal pathways in which these 'proximal' causes lie.",,,,,10.1136/adc.74.2.176,1996-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Logan', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Child Health, London.'}, {'lastname': 'Spencer', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]"
8591433,An interactive consultation multimedia software for orthodontic patients.,[],Medinfo. MEDINFO,"Presentation of diagnosis and treatment planning for orthodontic problems by orthodontists is often a hurdle and a nuisance to most patients. The reasons are that it has much content which may be hard to understand without having expert knowledge related to the temporal change in dentofacial structures known as the growth, development and physiological aspects of masticatory apparatus. To complement this, we have developed an interactive consultation multimedia software for orthodontic patients. he design concept of the current software has three aspects. Firstly, since the software is operated by orthodontic patients themselves or by their parents, it enhances the operational feasibility. Secondly, it helps the patients choose the information in which they are interested. Thirdly, it emphasizes audio-visual understanding of orthodontic practice, including terminology. e used a hypertext machine with a 240MB hard disk drive, an 8MB RAM and a 13 inch color monitor. In developing the current software, we also used a video camera, a video color board, a microphone, and an image scanner together with an image recorder, a movie and sound data editing system, image scanning and editing, an image changer, a spread sheet and mathematical software. he current software consists of various multimedia such as images, sounds, characters, and biosignals. The ""stack"" of the software consists of three parts: a) ""General Understanding of Occlusion"" b) ""Understanding Specific Types of Occlusion Exhibited by the Patient"" c) ""Orthodontic Terminology"" When card A is selected the patient can choose either ""Good Occlusion"" or ""Malocclusion."" If ""Malocclusion"" is chosen, respective occlusal types are shown. The next card provides pathological conditions caused by respective malocclusion, e.g., gingivitis. After selecting card B which asks the patient, ""What do your teeth look like?"" the following buttons are provided: ""Maxillary Protrusion,"" ""Reversed Occlusion,"" ""Crowding,"" ""Open Bite,"" and ""Spaced Arch."" After selecting one of these, the card with an explanation of the respective malocclusion is shown according to the patient's physiological age. Finally, after card C is selected, a new card which has a list of orthodontic terminology is presented. Patients can search any term according to their choice to open a new card which gives a detailed explanation. e confirmed that the current consultation multimedia software can provide a comfortable environment to the patients and their families to learn where the orthodontic problems lie and how they could be solved.",,,,,,1995-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Miyawaki', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthodontics, Osaka University Faculty of Dentistry, 1-8Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Takada', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Furukawa', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Adachi', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]"

The future of our industry will be total health care systems expanding far beyond hospitals. There is and will be a greater need to provide information for decision making in the vast areas of alternative delivery, preventative medicine, industrial and occupational medicine, and the adult long-term care market. Large, non-health care corporations and business coalitions will have a strong influence on our industry. Terminals will be set up in the workplace for early detection of disease and to provide wellness programs. Due to severe financial pressures, we will finally be forced to use our technology for medical research and to provide access to national data bases to provide better health care and allow for prevention, early detection, and a faster cure of some diseases. The nurse consultant will play a major role in this area. This evolution will happen only over time. As many mergers take place among the major health care vendors, we can only wonder what this does to our industry. As larger consolidated corporations sort their priorities, entrepreneurs will have the ideal opportunity to use their creative ability to provide products and services to the industry. The survivors will be those firms and institutions providing the best and most flexible service at a competitive price. What is important in this market is the people. They must be global thinkers with an understanding of the present and future of the health care market. They must be managers who are flexible and able to creatively use resources and technology. In both a profit and nonprofit environment, these leaders will be required to be risk takers, decision makers, and operate in a proactive manner.
